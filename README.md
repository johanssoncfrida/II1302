# Door Display

## About

This web application is part of a project made for the course II1302 at KTH. The Door Display project's purpose is to enable for a user to have a display outside of the office with a message showing. The user updates the message using the web application and the hardware display fetches the message from the database using a wifi module. 

To update a message the user must create an account and sign in. The message can then be viewed both on the display and in the web page. 

The web application project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

To run the web application, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../the_project_folder
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will runs the web app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Run Jest tests

To run the tests, run this command in the project directory:

```
$ npm test
```

## Run Selenium tests

Before the Selenium tests can be run, Geckodriver must be added in your system's PATH variable.
